I received my Ph.D degree in Traffic Information Engineering and Control from Shanghai Maritime University in 2023. From 2021 to 2022, I was a visiting Ph.D. Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the University of Victoria, Canada. I am currently a lecturer with the School of Computer and Information Engineering, Changzhou Institute of Technology. My research interests include wireless sensor networks, underwater acoustic sensor networks, localization and tracking, Intelligent prediction and deep learning, and so on. I have published 20+ papers with
